<title>EV 99Â¢ PIZZA</title>
<body>

<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>I had never come across something such as 99c pizza before I moved to New York. I now consider it one of my favorite things in the world. It is a staple of almost every city block. It is always here after a night out, when you are in a rush, or when you can't afford anything else. 
This website is a documentation and review of (almost) all of the dollar slice pizza spots in the East Village area, conducted by me, Chloe Nini! Enjoy it!</p>
